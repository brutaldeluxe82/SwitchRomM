# RomM Switch Client – Design Notes

Audience: senior C++ devs working on `romm-switch-client/`. Snapshot of constraints, principles, and near-term plan.

## Goals
- Stable SDL2/libnx client for RomM: browse platforms/ROMs, queue downloads, split for FAT32/DBI, show progress, stay responsive.
- Network is `http://` only (no TLS); intended for trusted LAN or TLS terminated upstream.
 - Controls follow standard Nintendo layout: A = confirm/select, B = back, Y = queue view/add to queue, X = search (index views) / start downloads (queue), Plus = settings, Minus = quit.

## Current Shape
- UI: `source/main.cpp` owns SDL init, config/API fetch, event/render loop, view state, text renderer, blocking cover loads.
- State: `include/romm/status.hpp` holds view enum, platform/ROM lists, queue, selections, progress atomics/strings, mutex.
- Input: `source/input.cpp` maps standard layout (A=Select/confirm, B=Back, Y=Queue view/add, X=Search on index views / Start downloads in queue, Plus=Settings, Minus=Quit). Device-auth pairing serves LOGIN (bearer token for all API calls) and save-sync (PLATFORMS SYNC index + SYNCROMS view; ZR/ZL cycles ROM/BIOS/SYNC).
- HTTP/API: `source/api.cpp` hand-rolled HTTP (http-only, timeouts, chunked decode), JSON via `mini/json.hpp`, helpers to fetch platforms/ROMs/details and pick `.xci/.nsp`.
- Downloader: `source/downloader.cpp` worker thread; preflight HEAD/Range; stream one GET per ROM; split into 0xFFFF0000 parts; finalize single vs multi-part; archive bit set; mutex guarding added in worker.
- Config/logging: `.env`/JSON at `sdmc:/switch/romm_switch_client/`; leveled logging to SD + stdout/nxlink.
- Tests (host): Catch2 for URL parsing and chunked decode.

## Principles
- Single HTTP behavior, reused by API, covers, downloader.
- UI thread owns UI state; workers use atomics + messages, not shared container mutation.
- Downloads are transactional: temp dir, expected size, atomic finalize, manifestable.
- Controls/hints must match.
- Logs are useful but bounded.
- Docs mirror reality (http-only, DBI layout, queue semantics).

## Risks / Gaps
- Shared state: mutex exists and render locks it, but access is inconsistent (strings/vectors raced); enforce single policy and snapshots.
- Resume correctness: planResume() accepts non-contiguous parts; temp dirs can collide (title-only) and final names can overwrite; size uses metadata vs server inconsistently.
- HTTP robustness: downloader short-writes (send once), no chunked detection for streaming, duplicate HTTP stacks, no redirects/TLS/IPv6.
- UI perf: per-frame filesystem exists checks for every ROM; blocking cover load on render thread.
- Cancellation: stop relies on timeouts; no socket shutdown to unblock.
- Queue UX: no per-item state or dedupe; failed items dropped; `navStack` unused.
- Logging: no rotation; debug can flood SD; logger not thread-safe.
- Config: `fat32Safe` unused; fast-fail on `https://` now enforced. (`apiToken` now carries the paired bearer token and is preferred over Basic on every request.)

## Plan (near-term)
P0 - correctness/safety (DONE)
- Status policy: non-trivial fields guarded via mutex/snapshots; racy reads curtailed; per-frame FS scans removed in favor of cached completion.
- Resume integrity: contiguous-only resume enforced; temp dirs keyed by rom/file IDs; collision-safe final naming; effective size prefers Content-Length when present (optional hashes still TODO).
- Networking: downloader send() loops; streaming detects chunked and fails loudly; server/metadata size alignment improved.
- Controls: canonical mapping A=Select, B=Back, Y=Queue, X=Download reflected in code, UI hints, docs; contradictory footers removed.

P1 - robustness/UX (active)
- Unify HTTP client (shared parse/connect/stream) to eliminate divergence; keep explicit chunked fail-fast for streaming unless adding support; structured errors; enforce http-only at config load; track active socket and `shutdown()` on stop.
- Logger hygiene: thread-safe sink, keep file handle open, add basic rotation/size cap to reduce SD wear.
- On-disk completion detection: account for ID-suffixed final filenames so badges stay accurate.
- Status locking audit: ensure all string/vector/error accesses are under mutex/snapshotted; consider event-queue model.
- Resume validation: strengthen beyond size-only when feasible (hash optional; server doesn’t provide).
- Queue/UI polish: async cover placeholder; consistent back-nav; keep failed/resumable visible; dedupe enqueues (already), ensure hints stay aligned.

P2 - quality
- Manifest + optional hashes; fsync temp/manifest; richer error codes.
- UI polish (paging/search optional), tidy navStack, config flag cleanup.
- Expand tests: URL builder, file selection, downloader segmentation/resume edge cases, input mapping, chunked detection/error, logger.
- Broader file support: make file selection heuristic extension-agnostic (allow emulator ROMs/zips), surface chosen filename in UI, and keep completion detection extension-agnostic while retaining human-readable fsName + ID suffix.
- HTTPS support: extend HTTP layer to optional TLS (currently http-only); design shared HTTP helpers with TLS-capable plumbing.

## Constraints / Deployment
- Network: http only; use on trusted LAN or behind TLS-terminating proxy.
- Output layout: FAT32/DBI splits (0xFFFF0000) in `<download_dir>/temp/<safe>.tmp/`, finalized to `<download_dir>/<fsName>` or `<fsName>/00 01 ...` with archive bit.
- Logging path: `sdmc:/switch/romm_switch_client/log.txt`; keep `LOG_LEVEL=info` for normal use.
